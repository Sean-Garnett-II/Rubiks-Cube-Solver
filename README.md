# Rubik's Cube Solver
Rubik's Cube Solver is a java program that solves a user defined Rubik's Cube configuration.

The algorithms used to solve the cube can be found at [ruwix.com](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/ "Beginner Solution")

## Status
The program is not ready to be built into a JAR.

I am currently working on the 'framework' for importing and manipulating the Rubkix's Cube.

My next task will be to search for cube states.
